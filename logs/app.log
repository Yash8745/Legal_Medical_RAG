2025-02-10 21:25:38,100 - INFO - app.py - Response: Mark Chandler received outpatient physical therapy for left shoulder pain and right foot drop. In the first session, his FADI score was 65%. Treatment included therapeutic exercises (hip abduction), manual therapy (cupping and ESTIM to thoracic paraspinals), and neuromuscular re-education (hurdles, balance exercises, NMES to anterior tibialis, heel raises, banded walks). Home exercises were prescribed. He tolerated the session well, with decreased tone and some reported discomfort. He has right hip instability and compensates for foot drop. Goals include independence with HEP, improved gait and hip abduction strength, and reduced pain. In the second session, his pain-free PROM into flexion/abduction/ER improved. He continues to demonstrate minimal to moderate tibialis anterior activation with manual resistance and may benefit from NMES. Goals include independence with HEP, pain-free left shoulder movement to allow for holding a rifle, improved external rotation for functional use of the left upper extremity, reduced pain, and return to sports/recreational activities. The third session included calf and hamstring stretches, manual therapy, and neuromuscular re-education. He was educated regarding findings, plan of care, goals, anatomy and biomechanics, and prognosis. A home exercise program was initiated.

2025-02-10 22:44:18,019 - INFO - app.py - Response: Three physical therapy sessions for Mark Chandler are summarized. The patient presents with L shoulder pain and R foot drop. Interventions included therapeutic exercise, neuromuscular re-education, manual therapy, gait training, patient education and self-management techniques. Goals focus on improving independence with HEP, gait, hip abduction strength, pain reduction, and return to prior level of function. Specific exercises target hip abduction, ankle dorsiflexion, and balance. Progress is noted in left shoulder PROM, ankle stability, and pain is improving, but deficits remain in right hip stability and ankle dorsiflexion. The patient is tolerating sessions well and remains appropriate for continued physical therapy. A fourth PT session for Patricia Callison with similar interventions is summarized.
